Your task
---------

The bookmark manager should not allow you to bookmark the same URL twice. The
duplicate-detection works correctly in most cases, but there is a bug: The
topmost URL can be bookmarked multiple times due to an implementation problem.

Hints:
You want to make changes to the addBookmark-function.
The a.indexOf(x) returns the index of the first occurrence of x within a. The
first element of a has index 0. If x is not in a, indexOf() returns -1. The
current implementation has an off-by-one mistake.




Your partner's task
-------------------

Your partner will add a check to ensure that only proper URLs can be added to
the list. The correct solution is to change the line

"if (bookmarks.indexOf(url) > 0) {"

to

"if (bookmarks.indexOf(url) > 0 || !this.isValidUrl(url)) {""

In the pull request, if your partner solved the task in a different way, ask
them to change their solution.
