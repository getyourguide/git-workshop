Your task
---------

The bookmark manager should not allow you to store strings that are not URLs in
the bookmark list. Add a corresponding check to prevent non-URLs from being
added.

Hints:
You want to make changes to the addBookmark-function.
The bookmarkStore object already implements a URL validation method, you just
have to call it.
The call looks like this: this.isValidUrl(url)
The logical OR-operator in JavaScript is ||
The logical NOT-operator in JavaScript is !




Your partner's task
-------------------

Your partner will fix a bug about duplicate detection in the addBookmark
function. They will most likely change the comparison
"bookmarks.indexOf(url) > 0" in one of the following ways:

Alternative 1:

bookmarks.indexOf(url) >= 0

Alternative 2:

bookmarks.indexOf(url) > -1

In the pull request, if your partner chose one of these alternatives, ask them
to change it to the other alternative. If your partner solved the problem in a
different way, ask them to change their solution to one of these alternatives.
